Machine Learning Class Assignment 1 - Diabetes Prediction
Project Overview
This Jupyter Notebook contains a machine learning project focused on predicting diabetes using a logistic regression model. The project follows a standard machine learning workflow, from data loading and exploration to model training and evaluation.

Key Features
Data Loading: Uses the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset (diabetes.csv) containing 768 patient records with 9 features:

Pregnancies

Glucose

BloodPressure

SkinThickness

Insulin

BMI

DiabetesPedigreeFunction

Age

Outcome (target variable)

Data Exploration:

Basic statistics and data shape

Missing value analysis

Correlation matrix visualization

Data Visualization:

Correlation heatmap to understand feature relationships

Other visualizations (though code isn't fully shown)

Model Building:

Uses scikit-learn's Logistic Regression

Includes train-test split (80-20 ratio)

Evaluates model using accuracy score and confusion matrix

Technical Details
Libraries Used:

pandas

numpy

matplotlib

seaborn

scikit-learn (for model implementation)

Machine Learning Techniques:

Logistic Regression (binary classification)

Standard evaluation metrics (accuracy, confusion matrix)

How to Use
Ensure you have all required libraries installed

Download the diabetes.csv dataset

Run the notebook cells sequentially to:

Load and explore the data

Visualize relationships between features

Train and evaluate the logistic regression model

Potential Improvements
Feature engineering to handle missing values (some features have 0 values that might represent missing data)

Try different classification algorithms (Random Forest, SVM, etc.)

Hyperparameter tuning for better model performance

More detailed visualization of model results

This project serves as a good foundation for binary classification problems in healthcare and demonstrates a complete machine learning workflow from data exploration to model evaluation.
